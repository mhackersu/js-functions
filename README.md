# JS Functions

In JavaScript, a function can be either first-order, or a higher-order function.

First-order functions are:

-   Functions that use only primitives or objects as arguments, and only return primitives or objects.

Higher-order functions are:

-   Functions that use other functions as arguments
-   Functions that return functions
